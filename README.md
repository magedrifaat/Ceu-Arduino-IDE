# Céu-Arduino-IDE
This is a modified version of the Arduino IDE that fully supports Céu-Language and the ceu-arduino binding.
## Installation
Download the latest release for your operating system (currently only Windows or Linux). For windows, the release is portable. For Linux, you can run the normal installation procedure for the Arduino IDE [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Linux).
## Usage
You can directly open your ceu files using the IDE but the files should be under a folder with the same name as the opened file (The IDE can do that automatically otherwise).

You can also try the Céu-Arduino examples under File->Examples->12.Ceu menu. You include Céu libraries directly from the IDE as well under Sketch->Include Library->Ceu Libraries menu.

You can compile the ceu sketch by pressing the verify button, and upload it to the board using the upload button just like the normal sketches.
